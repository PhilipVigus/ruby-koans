# Ruby Koans
This repository includes files downloaded and edited while working through the set of tutorials available at [rubykoans.com](http://rubykoans.com/).

The basic workflow was to run the following script while in the project's root directory:
```ruby
ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb
``` 
This runs a set of automated tests set up to fail with instructive messages that you incrementally fix.
